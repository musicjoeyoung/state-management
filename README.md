# state-management

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is for learning purposes. I will have 3 iterations of the same product that deal with managing state. One will use strictly `useState`, another `useContext`, and another `Zustand` so that I may better illustrate and understand the pros and cons of each approach given a project that should (ideally) *need* a state management library (like Zustand). This will also be my opportunity to learn Zustand.
